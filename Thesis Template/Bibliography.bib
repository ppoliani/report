abstract ={Motivation: In silico experiments in bioinformatics involve the co-ordinated use of computational tools and information repositories. A growing number of these resources are being made available with programmatic access in the form of Web services. Bioinformatics scientists will need to orchestrate these Web services in workflows as part of their analyses.Results: The Taverna project has developed a tool for the composition and enactment of bioinformatics workflows for the life sciences community. The tool includes a workbench application which provides a graphical user interface for the composition of workflows. These workflows are written in a new language called the simple conceptual unified flow language (Scufl), where by each step within a workflow represents one atomic task. Two examples are used to illustrate the ease by which in silico experiments can be represented as Scufl workflows using the workbench application.Availability: The Taverna workflow system is available as open source and can be downloaded with example Scufl workflows from http://taverna.sourceforge.net},

Provenance information is essential if experiments are to be validated and verified by others, or even by those who originally performed them. In this article, we give an overview of our initial work on the provenance of bioinformatics e-Science experiments within myGrid. We use two kinds of provenance: the derivation path of information and annotation. We show how this kind of provenance can be delivered within the myGrid demonstrator WorkBench and we explore how the resulting Webs of experimental data holdings can be mined for useful information and presentations for the e-Scientist.}

        abstract = {Given the significant increase of on-line services that require personal information from users, the risk that such information is misused has become an important concern. In such a context, information accountability is desirable since it allows users (and society in general) to decide, by means of audits, whether information is used appropriately. To ensure information accountability, information flow should be made transparent. It has been argued that data provenance can be used as the mechanism to underpin such a transparency. Under these conditions, an audit's quality depends on the quality of the captured provenance information. Thereby, the integrity of provenance information emerges as a decisive issue in the quality of a provenance-based audit. The aim of this paper is to secure provenance-based audits by the inclusion of cryptographic elements in the communication between the involved entities as well as in the provenance representation. This paper also presents a formalisation and an automatic verification of a set of security properties that increase the level of trust in provenance-based audit results.}

The increased use of software in automating activities provides the opportunity to add greatly to the amount we can know about an entity?s history and the process by which it came to be as it is. However, it also presents difficulties: querying for the provenance of an entity could potentially return detailed information stretching back to the beginning of time, and most of it irrelevant to the querier. In this paper, we define the concept of provenance query and describe techniques that allow us to perform scoped provenance queries.}

However, for any person undertaking a carbon footprinting analysis for the first time, they will almost certainly be struck by the broad array of definitions, approaches and terminology surrounding the field. This paper provides an introductory guide to some basic concepts in carbon footprinting for researchers and lay people interested in the area. Each stage of calculating a carbon footprint is considered and an introduction to the main methodologies is provided. The advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches are discussed and a rough framework of procedures is provided for the calculation of carbon footprints over a variety of subjects. Some general data sources and a glossary of key carbon footprinting terminology are included}

        abstract = {As the threat of climate change becomes more acute, so does the need for adequate measures of impact(s), management and mitigation. Although carbon footprints are increasingly being used by organizations in the public and private sectors, a number of challenges and questions need to be addressed, not least, what does the term carbon footprint actually mean? The term needs a universally accepted definition before a consistent, accurate, comparable and transferable methodology can be developed. This paper investigates the range of current definitions proposed for a carbon footprint in the context of inventoried emissions, applications, boundaries and limitations. We argue that to only account for CO2 emissions would result in the omission of almost one-quarter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and a significant gap in their global management, whilst inclusion of all GHGs is very time-consuming and expensive, and should be considered only in system specific life cycle assessment (LCA) based assessments; this requires a separate definition, name and methodology. We suggest that as data collection for CO2 and CH4 emissions is relatively straightforward, these two carbon based gases should be used in the determination of a ?carbon footprint.? This should allow the carbon footprint to become a cost-effective, practical and repeatable metric that can be adopted by all types of organizations across the globe as a ?baseline? indicator. However, it is likely that a more comprehensive metric will be required in some circumstances and by some organizations, so we also propose further GHG inclusion for full LCA based assessments, where complete data is obtainable it can be used to provide a ?climate footprint?. This name reflects the addition of non-carbon based gases and encompasses the full range of gases used in the global political community?s response in managing climate change. We conclude by considering lessons learnt with the proposal of sound and pragmatic definitions}

As centers of high consumption, wealth and creativity, cities must play a significant role in tackling climate change. Action to reduce emissions at a local level requires that municipal and local governments have a good understanding of emissions sources and reduction potentials. To achieve this municipal governments require adequate tools and resources to enable effective policy decision making. The carbon footprint is becoming an increasingly recognized tool for the management of climate change. The term carbon footprint originated in the grey literature, it is widely recognized in the public arena. It offers the opportunity to municipal governments to develop models to inform climate change strategy decision making. Enabling municipal authorities to localize the issue climate change and promote the benefits of climate change mitigation at the local level. Existing framework guidance often fails to include all relevant emissions or follow widely varying methodologies, limiting comparability. This paper examines the concept of climate change localization and management. The carbon footprint is explored in the context of a tool for municipal government management of GHG emissions. We conclude by suggesting the carbon footprint become a cost-effective, practical and repeatable metric that can be adopted municipal governments across the globe as a ?baseline? indicator.}

We discuss the security considerations pertaining to a Service Oriented Architecture based provenance system. Concurrently, we outline possible approaches to address them.}

    abstract = {Life science researchers increasingly rely on the web as a primary source of data, forcing them to apply the same rigor to its use as to an experiment in the laboratory. The \${}^{\mbox{\scriptsize my}}\$Grid project is developing the use of workflows to explicitly capture web-based procedures, and provenance to describe how and why results were produced. Experience within \${}^{\mbox{\scriptsize my}}\$Grid has shown that this provenance metadata is formed from a complex web of heterogenous resources that impact on the production of a result. Therefore we have explored the use of Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, and ontologies to support its representation and used existing initiatives such as Jena and LSID, to generate and store such material. The effective presentation of complex RDF graphs is challenging. Haystack has been used to provide multiple views of provenance metadata that can be further annotated. This work therefore forms a case study showing how existing Semantic Web tools can effectively support the emerging requirements of life science research.},

This system, termed the pre-prototype, is based on a conceptualized process for baking a Victoria Sponge Cake. This report describes the cake baking scenario, presents some provenance-type questions that can be asked about the baking process and provides an implementation of the cake baking process within a service-oriented architecture framework that can answer these questions using collated provenance data. }
