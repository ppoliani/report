The awareness of the damage we bring to the environments is considerably important. Each and every one should have knowledge of the weight of carbon emissions that his activities cause to the environment.  The web application that is described in this report provides a means for the users of an organization (e.g. Universities) to monitor the carbon emissions caused by their travelling habits. This is extended with a feature that allows them to verify and make trust judgments about the values that are produced by the application.
We started the report with a description of the theory underpinning the provenance of electronic data technology. In addition to that, the bits of the carbon footprint theory that we used in our application were presented, with emphasis given methods for calculating carbon emissions caused by travelling activities.

A separate chapter was dedicated to explaining the benefits that the provenance technology adds to the application. Finally, a substantial amount of work was devoted to designing and implementing the web and mobile applications.  We discussed the methodology that was followed to complete each stage in two separate chapters.
